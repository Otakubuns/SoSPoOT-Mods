### Config values
*The game needs to be run once with the mod in order for the config file to show up*


**TimeScale** = Speed of the in game time, the lower the longer an in game minute will pass (default 60)

**TimeInside** = Disables time passing indoors like in OG SoS games (default true)

If an area is still frozen outdoors let me know which area as I am not far in the game and have added all the areas I could think of for outdoors(it's mostly 
likely the area isnt registered into the list of outdoor ids I use to check if you're outdoor or not.)
