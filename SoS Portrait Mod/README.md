The sprite is loaded whenever a conversation is started so technically you can change the sprite in game if you replace the photo and initiate the conversation again.
## Issues
- Some sprites aren't perfect but most characters have no issues(dlc characters arent done yet).
- There are plans to make sure all sprites fit perfectly its just not done yet.
- ~~No idea if these work in cutscenes/events~~ **Added in 1.0.1 for cutscenes(I assume the code for heart events is the same)**
- Photos not the size of 350X320 will look stretched(working on fixing that)

## Future Plans
- (DLC Characters) Add happy/love sprite for liked/loved items
- (Possibly) Try to make the sprites preloaded(had issues with this due to il2cpp compiling)
